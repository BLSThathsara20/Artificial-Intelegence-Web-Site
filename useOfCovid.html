                <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <h3>Background and aims</h3>
                <p>Healthcare delivery requires the support of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Machine 
                    Learning to fight and look ahead against the new diseases. We aim to review the role of AI as a decisive 
                    technology to analyze, prepare us for prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics.
                </p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of 
                    COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the 
                    latest information regarding AI for COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this disease.
                </p>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster 
                    of cases and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and analyzing all previous data.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. 
                    This result-driven technology is used for proper screening, analyzing, prediction and tracking of current patients 
                    and likely future patients. The significant applications are applied to tracks data of confirmed, recovered and death cases.
