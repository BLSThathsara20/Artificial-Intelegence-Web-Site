                    <p class="p_s">While modern narrow AI may be limited to performing specific tasks, within their 
                        specialisms these systems are sometimes capable of superhuman performance, 
                        in some instances even demonstrating superior creativity, a trait often held up as intrinsically human.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">There have been too many breakthroughs to put together a definitive list, but some 
                        highlights include: in 2009 Google showed it was possible for its self-driving Toyota Prius to 
                        complete more than 10 journeys of 100 miles each, setting society on a path towards driverless vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p  class="p_s_2">
                        In 2011, the computer system IBM Watson made headlines worldwide when it won the US quiz show Jeopardy!, beating two 
                        of the best players the show had ever produced. To win the show, Watson used natural language processing and analytics on 
                        vast repositories of data that it processed to answer human-posed questions, often in a fraction of a second.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">
                        In 2012, another breakthrough heralded AI's potential to tackle a multitude of new tasks previously thought of as too complex for any machine. 
                        That year, the AlexNet system decisively triumphed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. 
                        AlexNet's accuracy was such that it halved the error rate compared to rival systems in the image-recognition contest.
                    </p>
                    <p  class="p_s_2">
                        AlexNet's performance demonstrated the power of learning systems based on neural networks, a model for machine learning that had existed for 
                        decades but that was finally realising its potential due to refinements to architecture and 
                        leaps in parallel processing power made possible by Moore's Law. The prowess of machine-learning systems at carrying out computer vision also 
                        hit the headlines that year, with Google training a system to recognise an internet favorite: pictures of cats.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">
                        The next demonstration of the efficacy of machine-learning systems that caught the public's attention was the 2016 triumph of the Google DeepMind 
                        AlphaGo AI over a human grandmaster in Go, an ancient Chinese game whose complexity stumped computers for decades. 
                        Go has about possible 200 moves per turn, compared to about 20 in Chess. Over the course of a game of Go, 
                        there are so many possible moves that searching through each of them in advance to identify the best 
                        play is too costly from a computational point of view. Instead, AlphaGo was trained how to play the game by 
                        taking moves played by human experts in 30 million Go games and feeding them into deep-learning neural networks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">
                        Training these deep learning networks can take a very long time, requiring vast amounts of data to be 
                        ingested and iterated over as the system gradually refines its model in order to achieve the best outcome.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">
                        However, more recently Google refined the training process with AlphaGo Zero, a system that played "completely random" games against itself, and then learnt from the results. 
                        Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also unveiled a new version of AlphaGo Zero that has mastered the games of chess and shogi.
