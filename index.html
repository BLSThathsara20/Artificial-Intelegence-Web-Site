            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to 
                think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that 
                exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

                    <h1>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
                    <p class="p_s">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to 
                        think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to 
                        any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the 
                        best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine 
                        learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt 
                        to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic 
                        learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.

                    <h1>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
                    <p class="p_s">When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually 
                        think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave 
                        stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p_s_2">Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that 
                        a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are 
                        even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.
